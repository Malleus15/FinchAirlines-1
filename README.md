A project developed as a work for Software Engineering Course at University of Catania.

The project has been developed using the Unified Processing approach with OO techniques, UML as modeling language and Java as programming language. 

In addition, testing has been executed over the single iteration in order to verify that the software has been meeting the requirements. The used testing tool is JUnit 5.

Finally, the software system has also been provided with persistence capabilities so that it could store data using a RDBS such as MySQL. The related Java library is java.sql.
